		<p>I believe that, whatever design problem you need to solve, you should face it with rationality, logic and careful analysis if you want to get to the right idea.
		Graphic design is always a synthetic work: you need to reduce and remove until you reach the core of the message. The essential goal is to obtain the best possible legibility.
		The computer has become an essential tool but its undisputed utility and versatility cannot replace knowledge. A good software does not necessarily create good graphics.
		Graphics is not an independent art, but a service. A good designer is the one who offers a good service through communication. A designer is good if he can solve a problem,
		if he puts forward a useful solution. I believe that these rules could be a good start for a career in design.<p>
