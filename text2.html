&nbsp;&nbsp;HOW USING EMOJI MAKES US LESS EMOTIONAL</p>

	<p>They allowed us to communicate without saying anything, saving us from spelling out any actual sentiments.</p>

	<p>The rules are fluid, though: Most emoji “can function as different parts of speech depending on context.”</p>

	<p>Emoji could even mark a return to a more pictographic script. Our earliest examples of writing come from the pictographic hieroglyphs and cuneiform inscriptions from Mesopotamia around 5,000 years ago. It was only around 1,200 BC that the Phoenicians developed the first alphabetic writing system. Could the rise of emoji mean we’re going backward?</p>

	<p>Zimmer, too, concedes that there are important limits on what emoji can communicate. He calls Emoji Dick “a fascinating project,” but notes: “If you look at those strings of emoji, they can’t stand on their own. They don’t convey the same message as the text on which they’re based.” After all, doesn’t quite have the same ring as “Call me Ishmael.”</p>
