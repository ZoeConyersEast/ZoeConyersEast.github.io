			<h1>More to femanism than flashing a bit of boob</h1>

			<h2>Susie O'brien</h2>
			<p>LAST year Vogue told us boobs were "out" but it would seem they've never gone away.</p>
			<p>Playboy's latest edition brings back the cetrefold, featuring a bare-chested model on the cover, telling us "naked is normal".</p>
			<p>At Paris Fashion Week, exhibitionist singer Nicki Minaj sits in the front row with one breast totally hanging out of her top; her nipple encased in a square of designer duct tape. And just about every day it seems topless campaigners from Femen or Free the Nipple are using their radical texta-encrypted breasts to make political points.</p>
			<p>It's all a bit of a yawn. We've seen it all before.</p>
			<p>But this week a serious Hollywood actor who's a card-carrying femanist bared a tiny bit of breast in a glossy magazine, and all hell broke loose.</p>
			<p>The celebrity in question was Emma Watson, who posed for Vanity Fair magazine wearing a bolero jacket that showed the bottom half of her breasts.</p>
			<p>No nipple. No texta. No wardrobe malfunction. No bizarre fashion statement.</p>
			<p>And yet the backlash was swift and fierce.</p>
			<p>Watson "complains that women are sexualised and then sexualises herself in her own work. hypocrisy," said one critic.</p>
			<p>"You can't claim to be fighting sexism if you use your boobs to advance you career," said another.</p>
			<p>Now, I would have thought some of the other photos in the spread would have caused more comment than the bolero one.</p>
			<p>In one, Watson is wearing Bombay bloomers and standing in a life-size wire birdcage and in another she looks like she's stapled to the wall wearing a straitjacket from Dior. But no. It seems that if you style yourself as a serious Hollywood feminist, you have to put your puppies away.</p>
			<p>I don't understand why no one is having a go at actor Scarlett Johansson for being interviewed in Playboy instead. Or Miley Cyrus for spending half the time with various body parts hanging out, or Minaj or Kim Kardashian.</p>
			<p>Why Watson? It's because she's being punished for being a feminist - people are trying to suggest that she can't be sexy and a feminist. Who would have thought we'd still be having this debate 60 years on? I don't buy the line that Watson is a bad feminist because she flashed her boob in an up-market glossy magazine photo-shoot.</p>
			<p>Watson, a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, has done enough to establish her fem-cred and a bit of breast isn't going to change that. Somewhat bemused, she spoke up, saying feminism comes down to women being able to "choose what they want to do".</p>
			<p>While I don't have a problem with the photo, I don't really think flashing a bit of boob is a feminist act in itself. The women's movement has become so commodified and commercialised that a rich, white, successful woman going braless and shirtless in a glossy photoshoot can be packaged up as a feminist act. Sorry Emma, I don't care about your bit of boob, but I just don't buy that line.</p>
			<p>Feminism is about social justice and a fight for equality; it's a movement for we, not just a movement for me. How's this picture helping anyone else except Vanity Fair to sell magazines, Disney promote its new film Beauty and the Beast and Watson sell herself?</p>
			<p>It's just like Free the Nipple, which seems to be full of publicity-hungry celebrities showcasing their pert and perfect breasts but doing absolutely nothing for anyone else.</p>
			<p>As I've written before, the right of women to go topless just isn't up there with equal pay or affordable childcare as an issue worth fighting for. I don't mean feminists have to be ugly or keep their tops firmly fastened. Clearly people have forgotten the heady sexual days of the 1970s, when women's libbers sported bouncy unbound breasts and sexy long hair (with matching underarms).</p>
			<p>With all of the bigger issues in the world to worry about, I wonder why a celebrity flashing a bit of boob is a concern to anyone?</p>
			<p>I am sure men are wondering what all the fuss is about, with many happy to peruse - as often as necessary - the images women are banging on about.</p>
