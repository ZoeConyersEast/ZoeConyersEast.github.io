		<strong> CREDO </strong> <em> - Bob Noorda </em>

		<p>I believe that, whatever design problem you need to solve, you should<br>face it with rationality, logic and careful analysis if you want to get to the right idea.
			<br>
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graphic design is always a synthetic work: you need to reduce and remove until<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you reach the core of the message. The essential goal is to obtain the best possible legibility.
			<br>
		<br>The computer has become an essential tool but its undisputed utility and versatility cannot<br>replace knowledge.
			<br>
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good software does not necessarily create good graphics.
			<br>
		<br>Graphics is not an independent art, but a service. A good designer is the one who offers a good<br>service through communication.
			<br>
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A designer is good ifhe can solve a problem,if he puts forward a useful solution. I believe that<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these rules could be a good start for a career in design.<p>
