<h1>"More to feminism than a flashing a bit of boob" - Susie O'Brien</h1>
<br>
<br>

<p>But this week a serious Hollywood actor who's a card-carrying feminist bared a bit of breast in a magazine, and all hell broke loose.</p>

<p>Emma Watson, who posed for Vanity Fair magazine wearing a bolero jacket that showed the bottom half of her breasts.</p>

<p>Watson "complains that women are sexualised and then sexualises herself in her own work. Hypocrisy," said one critic.</p>

<p>"You can't claim to be fighting sexism if you use your boobs to advance your career," said another critic.</p>

<p>'It seems that if you style yourself as a serious Hollywood feminist, you have to put your puppies away.' - Susie O'Brien</p>

<p>'People are trying to suggest that she can't be sexy and a feminist'. - Susie O'Brien</p>

<p>"Feminism comes down to women being able to choose "what they want to do" - Emma Watson</p>

<p>The women's movement has become so commercialised that a rich, successful woman going braless in a photo can be  a feminist act.</p>

<p>'Feminism is about social justice - How is this picture helping anyone except Vanity Fair to sell magazines' - Susie O'Brien</p>

<p>'The right of women to go topless just isn't up there with equal pay or affordable childcare as an issue worth fighting for.' -Susie O'Brien</p>
