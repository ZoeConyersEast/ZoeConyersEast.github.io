<p> &nbsp; TEXT 3 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;NOBODY KNOWS WHAT YOUR EMOJIS MEAN</p>

	<p>Emojis, the little smiley faces and characters that can be added into texts, emails, and chat messages are a language all their own. But this international lexicon has one big problem: No one can agree on exactly what's being said when we send each other emojis.
	<br>

	<p>In the study, researchers talked to 334 people across the U.S. who analyzed emojis from Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and LG. The researchers asked the participants what they thought the emojis meant, how they would describe them, and how they might use them.</p>

	<p>And they found that about 25% of the time, even when people are viewing the exact same emoji picture on the exact same kind of device, they disagree about whether the emotion being conveyed by the emoji is positive, negative, or neutral.</p>

	<p>For now, the researchers press it's just important to know your emojis may not be received the way they were intended. And maybe that's just part of the inherent silly fun of exchanging emojis: that potential emoji fail, that possibility for misinterpretation.</p>

	<p>HOW I CREATED THE CONTENT</p>

	<p>All the readings I have found debate the use of emojis in terms of socialising and wether or not it is an effective way of communicating with one another.</p>
