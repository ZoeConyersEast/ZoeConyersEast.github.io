PROJECT 3

<br>
TEXT 1: THE CONSERVATISM OF EMOJI READING
<br>
<br>
Emoji offer you new possibilities for digital expression, but only if you’re speaking their language
<br>
<br>
<i>If you smile through your fear and sorrow <br>
Smile and maybe tomorrow <br>
You’ll see the sun come shining through for you <br>
—Nat King Cole, “Smile”</i>
<br>
<br>
The world will soon have its first emoji-only social network: Emoj.li. This news, announced in late June, was met with a combination of scorn and amusement from the tech press. It was seen as another entry in the gimmick-social-network category, to be filed alongside Yo.
<br>
<br>
Emoji are the social lubricant smoothing the rough edges of our digital lives: They underscore tone, introduce humor, and give us a quick way to bring personality into otherwise monochrome spaces. All this computerized work is, according to Michael Hardt, one face of what he terms immaterial labor, or “labor that produces an immaterial good, such as a service, knowledge, or communication.” “We increasingly think like computers,” he writes, but “the other face of immaterial labor is the affective labor of human conduct and interaction” — all those fast-food greetings, the casual banter with the Uber driver, the flight attendant’s smile, the nurse patting your arm as the needle goes in.
<br>
<br>
In many ways, emoji offer us a deeply restricted world. This character set is valorized for its creative uses — such as Emoji Dick, Fred Benenson’s crowdsourced, book-length rewriting of Melville’s Moby Dick as emoji, which was accepted into the Library of Congress.  But it is also constrained at the level of social and political possibility.
<br>
<br>
<br>

TEXT 2: OBSESSED WITH EMOJI: WHY WE LOVE THEM SO MUCH
<br>
<br>
People love emoji, that’s no secret. But I mean we really, really love them. <br>
<br>
The rise of messaging apps and the natural human impulse towards visual shorthand has meant that emoticons and then then emoji and stickers have become our digital shorthand for a variety of things we couldn’t be bothered typing.
As our communications steadily entered a more visual realm – that of image and video sharing via messaging apps – our abbreviations became more visual as well.
Emoji imbue our textual communications with a little more feeling in the absence of tone and body language.
<br>
<br>
So the next time someone you know complains about the use of emoji, let them know that emoji usage is one step closer to real-time hologram comms or whatever it is we’ll be using in 20 years. Emoji are simply one of the first steps toward making internet-based communications more lifelike. If we can’t be there in the flesh to add non-verbal flair to what we’re saying, emoji are the next best thing. And if you think something with the power, adaptability and ubiquity of language, the emotional, contextual and expressive capabilities of human reactions and the universal comprehensibility of emoji couldn’t one day supplant some tired old cartoon characters, think again.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TEXT 3: HOW USING EMOJI MAKES US LESS EMOTIONAL
<br>
<br>
They allowed us to communicate without saying anything, saving us from spelling out any actual sentiments.
<br>
<br>
The rules are fluid, though: Most emoji “can function as different parts of speech depending on context.”
<br>
<br>
Emoji could even mark a return to a more pictographic script. Our earliest examples of writing come from the pictographic hieroglyphs and cuneiform inscriptions from Mesopotamia around 5,000 years ago. It was only around 1,200 BC that the Phoenicians developed the first alphabetic writing system. Could the rise of emoji mean we’re going backward?
<br>
<br>
Zimmer, too, concedes that there are important limits on what emoji can communicate. He calls Emoji Dick “a fascinating project,” but notes: “If you look at those strings of emoji, they can’t stand on their own. They don’t convey the same message as the text on which they’re based.” After all, doesn’t quite have the same ring as “Call me Ishmael.”
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TEXT 4: NOBODY KNOWS WHAT YOUR EMOJIS MEAN
<br>
<br>
Emojis, the little smiley faces and characters that can be added into texts, emails, and chat messages are a language all their own. But this international lexicon has one big problem: No one can agree on exactly what's being said when we send each other emojis.
<br>
<br>
In the study, researchers talked to 334 people across the U.S. who analyzed emojis from Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and LG. The researchers asked the participants what they thought the emojis meant, how they would describe them, and how they might use them.
<br>
<br>
And they found that about 25% of the time, even when people are viewing the exact same emoji picture on the exact same kind of device, they disagree about whether the emotion being conveyed by the emoji is positive, negative, or neutral.
<br>
<br>
For now, the researchers press it's just important to know your emojis may not be received the way they were intended. And maybe that's just part of the inherent silly fun of exchanging emojis: that potential emoji fail, that possibility for misinterpretation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HOW I CREATED THE CONTENT
<br>
<br>
All the readings I have found debate the use of emojis in terms of socialising and wether or not it is an effective way of communicating with one another.
