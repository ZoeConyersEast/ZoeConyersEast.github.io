			<li>I believe that, whatever design problem you need to solve, you should face it with rationality,
				logic and careful analysis if you want to getto the right idea.</li>
			<li>Graphic design is always a synthetic work: you need to reduce and remove until you reach the core
				of the message. The essential goal is to obtain the best possible legibility.</li>
			<li>The computer has become an essential tool but its undisputed utility and versatility cannot replace
				knowledge. A good software does not necessarily create good graphics.</li>
			<li>Graphics is not an independent art, but a service.</li>
			<li>A good designer is the one who offers a good service through communication.</li>
			<li>A designer is good if he can solve a problem, if he puts forward a useful solution.</li>
			<li>I believe that these rules could be a good start for a career in design.</li>
