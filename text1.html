	<p>People love emoji, that’s no secret. But I mean we really, really love them.</p>

	<p>The rise of messaging apps and the natural human impulse towards visual shorthand has meant that emoticons and then then emoji and stickers have become our digital shorthand for a variety of things we couldn’t be bothered typing. As our communications steadily entered a more visual realm – that of image and video sharing via messaging apps – our abbreviations became more visual as well. Emoji imbue our textual communications with a little more feeling in the absence of tone and body language.</p>

	<p>So the next time someone you know complains about the use of emoji, let them know that emoji usage is one step closer to real-time hologram comms or whatever it is we’ll be using in 20 years. Emoji are simply one of the first steps toward making internet-based communications more lifelike. If we can’t be there in the flesh to add non-verbal flair to what we’re saying, emoji are the next best thing. And if you think something with the power, adaptability and ubiquity of language, the emotional, contextual and expressive capabilities of human reactions and the universal comprehensibility of emoji couldn’t one day supplant some tired old cartoon characters, think again.</p>
