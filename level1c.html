		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that, whatever design<br>problem you need to solve,you<br>should face it with rationality, logic<br>and careful analysis if you want<br>to get to the right idea.
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graphic design is always a<br>synthetic work: you need to reduce<br>and remove until you reach the core <br>of the message.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential goal is to obtain the<br>best possible legibility.
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer has become<br>an essential tool but its undisputed<br>utility and versatility cannot replace<br>knowledge.
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good software does not<br>necessarily create good graphics.
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graphics is not an independent art,<br>but a service. A good designer is the<br>one who offers a good service through<br>communication.
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A designer is good ifhe can solve a <br>problem,if he puts forward a useful<br>solution. I believe that these rules<br>could be a good start for a career in<br>design.<p>
